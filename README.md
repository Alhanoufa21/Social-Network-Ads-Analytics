# Social-Network-Ads-Analytics


## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning framework to analyze and predict user purchasing behavior based on social network advertisements. The goal is to utilize predictive modeling to understand the effectiveness of ads and optimize strategies for targeting potential buyers on social media platforms.

## Description

This project leverages a dataset titled "Social Network Ads" to build and train machine learning models that can predict purchasing decisions. Using decision tree classifiers and logistic regression, the project aims to dissect user behavior through demographic factors like age and income. The performance of these models is meticulously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, providing detailed insights into each model's effectiveness.

## Features

- Predictive Modeling: Employ decision tree classifiers and logistic regression to predict user responses to advertisements.
- Comprehensive Metrics Evaluation: Analyze model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- Insightful Data Analysis: Provide strategic insights into ad effectiveness and user targeting for social media platforms.
- Data Visualization: Visual representations of data and model performance to aid in understanding and decision-making.

## Technologies
- Machine Learning: Utilized Python and its libraries, including scikit-learn, for building and training models.
- Data Analysis: Employed Python's pandas and numpy for data preprocessing and analysis.
- Visualization Tools: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations of the data and results.
